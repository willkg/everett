==========================
Using the Sphinx extension
==========================

No one likes to spend hours updating configuration documentation. Often, it's
accidentally forgotten or overlooked when maintaining a project.

No one likes to spend hours trying to get something to work only to discover the
configuration documentation is out of date, missing important information, or
just wrong.

Blech.

Everett comes with a `Sphinx <https://http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_
extension to make it easier to document Everett components and configuration.
This allows you to write configuration code and have it automatically documented
in your Sphinx-generated docs without having to manually update it.

Further, Everett components will show up in the index making it easier for users
to find what they're looking for.
